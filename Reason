To put it roughly, no reason to be good, or you to do things in a good way.
Taking it as an oversimplification, love and let love.
'Because you are loved. They don't care about you. Come Home.'

Just because you don't have reasons in good direction doesn't mean you have reasons in bad direction.
Some people search for reasons outside of them, while some people search for reasons in the inside.
I have realized there is no reason in good direction for me in the inside, but reason in bad direction from outside.
It depends on how you see the world as 'place where it can be good with good reasons' or as 'place where it can be bad with bad reasons.'
One observation might be, 'nothing is there for granted.'
Therefore, you find your own good reasons and overcome and integrate bad ones.
