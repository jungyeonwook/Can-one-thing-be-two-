practice the focus (sitting, unfolding fingers)
aim as accurately as possible and as often as possible and as quick as possible
law of attraction; send them messages and use their thoughts, and let your ideas be in use for them.
send your fresh blood to your weak regions of your body.
signal the weak parts so that you strenghten that part of your neurophysiology.
don't see how others show, but see how what messages they give you when they see who you are.
Send the blood and to change your neuron physiology.
Never bring something somewhere.
Focus on things that are near you and absorb. Send blood and reparir the nuerophysiology.
